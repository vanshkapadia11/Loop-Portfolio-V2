## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Frontend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Vite** – Fast bundling and dev server
- **Dark Mode** – Fully themeable UI
- **Responsive Design** – Works across all screen sizes

## ✨ Features

- Personal intro section with headline
- Services / "What I offer" section
- Recent blog posts
- Dark mode toggle
- Clean grid layout using Tailwind
- Fully responsive and accessible

  For Brave browser users:

  You can add a small message:
  "If dark mode doesn't work, try turning off Brave Shields or use Chrome."
  (Just to save your future users confusion.)

  Keep the theme toggle clean using localStorage + useEffect → You already nailed this.

  Optional polish:

  Avoid flicker on first load (we can add a .no-transition class initially and remove it with JS).

  Animate background/text change smoothly (you’re already using Tailwind transitions well).
